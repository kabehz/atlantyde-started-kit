# Python SDK is a software development kit for building applications on the Atl0s platform.
# It provides a set of tools and libraries to interact with the Atl0s API and perform various operations.
# ## Installation
# To install the Atl0s SDK, you can use pip, the Python package manager. Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install atl0s-sdk
```
# ## Usage
# To use the Atl0s SDK, you need to import the library and create an instance of the Atl0s class. You can then use the methods provided by the SDK to interact with the Atl0s platform.
```python
from atl0s_sdk import Atl0s
# Create an instance of the Atl0s class
atl0s = Atl0s(api_key='your_api_key', api_secret='your_api_secret')
# Get the current balance
balance = atl0s.get_balance()
print(f'Current balance: {balance}')
# Get the current price of a token
price = atl0s.get_price('BTC')
print(f'Current price of BTC: {price}')
# Get the current price of a token in a specific currency
price = atl0s.get_price('BTC', 'USD')
print(f'Current price of BTC in USD: {price}')
# Get the current price of a token in a specific currency with a specific exchange
price = atl0s.get_price('BTC', 'USD', 'Binance')
print(f'Current price of BTC in USD on Binance: {price}')
# Get the current price of a token in a specific currency with a specific exchange and a specific market
price = atl0s.get_price('BTC', 'USD', 'Binance', 'spot')
print(f'Current price of BTC in USD on Binance spot market: {price}')
